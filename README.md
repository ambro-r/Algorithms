# Algorithms

## Objectives: 

Implementation of various Algorithms in Java. 

## Graph Algorithms:

* [Breath first search (BFS)][1]: Starting at a specific node, explore all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
* [Depth first search (DFS)][2]: Starting at a specific node, explore as far (deep) as possible along each branch before backtracking.
* [Iterative deepening depth first search (IDDFS)][3]: A depth-limited version of DFS that runs repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found. BFS is performed at each level. 
* [A-Star Search][4]: Find shortest path from a specified starting point to a specified destination, by finding a path that minimizes f(x) = g(x) + h(x)
